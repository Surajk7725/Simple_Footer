## Project Structure

- **HTML File (`index.html`):**
  - The HTML file defines the structure of the web page.
  - The body of the document contains a footer with two main sections: `footer-content` and `footer-bottom`.
  - The `footer-content` section includes a title (`h3`), a description (`p`), and a list of social media icons (`ul`).
  - It covers various aspects, including background colors, font styles, spacing, and the design of social media icons.
  - The stylesheet uses media queries for responsiveness, adjusting the layout for screens with a maximum width of 500 pixels.

## Styling

### Body and Footer Styles
- The body has a light background color (`#fcfcfc`), and the footer has a dark background color (`#111`).
- The footer is fixed at the bottom of the page using the `position: absolute;` property.

### Social Media Icons (`ul` and `.wrapper`)
- Social media icons are presented in a flex container with individual list items (`li`) for each icon.
- Each icon is styled with a circular background, padding, and a subtle box shadow for a 3D effect.
- Hover effects change the background color and add a tooltip with a slight shadow.
- Icons for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Github, and Youtube are included.
- Each icon is a link (`<a>`) wrapped around an `<i>` element from the Font Awesome library.

## Deployment
- The web page is deployed on GitHub Pages and can be accessed at [https://surajk7725.github.io/Simple_Footer/](https://surajk7725.github.io/Simple_Footer/).
